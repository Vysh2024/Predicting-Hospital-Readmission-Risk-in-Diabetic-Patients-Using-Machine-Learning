# Predicting-Hospital-Readmission-Risk-in-Diabetic-Patients-Using-Machine-Learning
Hospital readmission within 30 days is a key quality indicator in healthcare. Diabetic patients are especially vulnerable due to the chronic nature of the disease. This project builds a machine learning model to predict the risk of readmission.
